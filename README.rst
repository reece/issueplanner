issueplanner -- create an unholy alliance between issue planners in
bitbucket (future: github too) and a GNOME planner document.  The
intention is to use Planner to generate planning documents with tasks
that optionally corresponde to issues in remote issue trackers. A
single planner may reference multiple issue trackers.
